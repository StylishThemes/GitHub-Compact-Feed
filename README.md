# GitHub Compact Feed [![tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed.svg)](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed/tags)

A userstyle that compacts and hides details in the news feed.

Almost all details are hidden in the feed, except:

* New repos and repos made public.
* Pull request details.
* Wiki changes maintain a link to the diff.

## Preview

## Customization

In version 1.1.0+, visibility of feed may be dynamically set within the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)' [configuration popup](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Popup).

All feed entries are visible by default. And this customization is *not available* through installation from userstyles.org because you would need to go to that site each time you want to change the visibility of an item.

## Installing

* If you're using a browser extension:
  * Stylus - get the addon for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/).
  * Stylish - get the addon for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/), [Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/) and [Firefox Mobile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/).
  * FreeStyler is available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/freestyler/hihigldmabkodfpehkgdemjklmaebmca).<br>
  * Then install this style using:
    * [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/160435/github-compact-feed)
    * or, add it [manually](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed/blob/master/github-compact-feed.user.css) into the editor.
* Or, **[install directly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StylishThemes/Github-Compact-Feed/master/github-compact-feed.user.css)** from this repository by opening the user.css file; only available using Stylus or FreeStyler (see the [documentation](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss)). :tada:

## Updating

If a recent change broke the style, chances are that we already fixed it. Make sure to reinstall from [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/160435/github-compact-feed) or [GitHub](https://github.com/StylishThemes/Github-Compact-Feed/raw/master/github-compact-feed.user.css) before opening an issue.
