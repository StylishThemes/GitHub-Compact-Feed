# GitHub Compact Feed [![tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed.svg)](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed/tags)

A userstyle that compacts and hides details in the news feed.

Almost all details are hidden in the feed, except:

* New repos and repos made public.
* Pull request details.
* Wiki changes maintain a link to the diff.

## Preview

## Customization

In version 1.1.0+, visibility of feed may be dynamically set within the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)' [configuration popup](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Popup).

All feed entries are visible by default. And this customization is *not available* through installation from userstyles.org because you would need to go to that site each time you want to change the visibility of an item.

## Installation

A userstyle extension is required, common ones include:

ðŸŽ¨ Stylus for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/).<br>
ðŸŽ¨ xStyle for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/xstyle/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xstyle/hncgkmhphmncjohllpoleelnibpmccpj).

Then:

ðŸ“¦ [Install the usercss](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed/raw/master/github-compact-feed.user.css) with Stylus or xStyle. Supports automatic updates.
